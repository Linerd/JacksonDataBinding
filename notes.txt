1.Meta has to be defined as a custom class, otherwise the client/server MUST use several type conversions to enable the get methods.
2.The data part has to be defined as a Map, coz the key is a variable, which is proved to be a violation of the condition under which a Json Object can be transformed into a YANG model.
3.If the value of a Map is a basic Java Type that cannot be inherited, like String, then defining it as basic type will make serialization easier. If custom classes are used, the output looks like this:
{
	"String variable name":"String variable value"
}
what we want is 
"String variable value"
